{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>When I came back from the meeting of the educational hall, I quickly found a strange thing: there were a lot of floats on the road, the car was hung with colorful ribbons, and some were still standing in front of the car with a doll, the scenery very. There is a large car that is a \"Lincoln\" brand, and it won't work. Count, a total of 32 vehicles. If we calculate according to the probability, we should have the same number in the same direction as ours, that is more than 60 vehicles. If you calculate according to the length of the road, then the people who get married in Shanghai today are probably amazing. I can't help but feel different.</p>\n<p>My heart has been thinking: \"What day is it today? Why are there so many people?\" At noon, I saw a graduate of the department at Donghu Hotel, and said that I was married tonight. Decided to come back to \"research.\" Come back to see the calendar, today is the lunar calendar September 18, the solar calendar 22, and Saturday. Three are double, probably Huang Daoji. So everyone is scheduled to be today.</p>\n<p>At the moment, it seems that people pay more attention to dates, numbers, time, etc. The date is preferably August 18th, or September 18th. The number is preferably 8th. In the past, for everyone on the number 4, there was a place where the taxi driver got a license with 4 and even burst into tears. However, there is now a new solution: 4 \"FA\" in the score, so I feel at ease. Such \"beliefs\", or folk customs, have recently prospered, and the past did not seem so strong.</p>\n<p>Probably this is also a multi-faceted reason, or the position of materialism in society and in people's minds has risen greatly, from the concept of belief abstraction to the number of \"belief\" unknown; or in a fast-changing society, People's grasp of their own destiny is more uncertain, and they hope that a kind of sustenance will ensure that they will not be lost in the unknown changes; or that people have no confidence in their own destiny, and they will let their fate flow with the tide.</p>\n<p>It’s understandable to ask for a good mood. But does this mean that the progress of society is stagnation?</p>","id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0165.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0165.md","frontmatter":{"title":"October 22 Saturday"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0165.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}
